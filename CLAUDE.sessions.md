# CLAUDE.sessions.md

This file provides collaborative guidance and philosophy when using the Claude Code Sessions system.

## Collaboration Philosophy

**Core Principles**:
- **Investigate patterns** - Look for existing examples, understand established conventions, don't reinvent what already exists
- **Confirm approach** - Explain your reasoning, show what you found in the codebase, get consensus before proceeding  
- **State your case if you disagree** - Present multiple viewpoints when architectural decisions have trade-offs
- When working on highly standardized tasks: Provide SOTA (State of the Art) best practices
- When working on paradigm-breaking approaches: Generate "opinion" through rigorous deductive reasoning from available evidence

## Task Management

### Best Practices
- One task at a time (check .claude/state/current_task.json)
- Update work logs as you progress  
- Mark todos as completed immediately after finishing

### Quick State Checks
```bash
cat .claude/state/current_task.json  # Shows current task
git branch --show-current             # Current branch/task
```

### current_task.json Format

**ALWAYS use this exact format for .claude/state/current_task.json:**
```json
{
  "task": "task-name",        // Just the task name, NO path, NO .md extension
  "branch": "feature/branch", // Git branch (NOT "branch_name")
  "services": ["service1"],   // Array of affected services/modules
  "updated": "2025-08-27"     // Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
}
```

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Using `"task_file"` instead of `"task"`
- ❌ Using `"branch_name"` instead of `"branch"`  
- ❌ Including path like `"tasks/m-task.md"`
- ❌ Including `.md` file extension


## Code Philosophy

### Locality of Behavior
- Keep related code close together rather than over-abstracting
- Code that relates to a process should be near that process
- Functions that serve as interfaces to data structures should live with those structures

### Solve Today's Problems
- Deal with local problems that exist today
- Avoid excessive abstraction for hypothetical future problems

### Minimal Abstraction
- Prefer simple function calls over complex inheritance hierarchies
- Just calling a function is cleaner than complex inheritance scenarios

### Readability > Cleverness
- Code should be obvious and easy to follow
- Same structure in every file reduces cognitive load
