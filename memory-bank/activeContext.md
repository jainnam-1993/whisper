# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-06-02 00:08:39 - Initial Memory Bank creation and setup

## Current Focus

* **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up project context and documentation structure
* **AWS Transcribe Integration Analysis**: Evaluating potential integration of AWS Transcribe as an alternative to local Whisper processing
* **Performance Comparison**: Need to assess speed and accuracy differences between local Whisper and cloud-based AWS Transcribe

## Recent Changes

* **2025-06-02 00:08:39**: Memory Bank system initialized for the Whisper Dictation project
* **Project Context Established**: Documented current architecture and key features of the existing Whisper-based system

## Open Questions/Issues

* **Privacy vs Performance Trade-off**: How to maintain the offline/privacy-first approach while potentially offering AWS Transcribe as a faster alternative?
* **Flag Implementation**: What would be the best way to implement a feature flag system to allow users to choose between local Whisper and AWS Transcribe?
* **Latency Comparison**: Need actual performance benchmarks between local Whisper models and AWS Transcribe API calls
* **Cost Implications**: AWS Transcribe has usage-based pricing - how would this affect the user experience?
* **Fallback Strategy**: Should AWS Transcribe be primary with Whisper as fallback, or vice versa?
[2025-06-02 00:31:00] - AWS Transcribe Streaming integration successfully completed and tested
  - All dependencies installed and verified working
  - streaming_transcribe_test.py ready for real-time transcription testing
  - Comprehensive documentation provided in README_streaming_test.md
  - Integration provides significant performance advantages over batch processing
## Current Focus

**2025-06-02 01:18:44** - AWS Transcribe Integration Complete - Ready for User Testing
- Implementation phase successfully completed with dual transcription backend architecture
- All core functionality implemented: abstract services, command line flags, resource management
- Comprehensive documentation created for setup and usage
- System ready for validation testing by end users

## Recent Changes

**2025-06-02 01:18:44** - Major Architecture Milestone: Dual Transcription Backend Implementation
- Successfully refactored monolithic Whisper application into pluggable transcription service architecture
- Implemented Strategy pattern with TranscriptionService abstract base class
- Added AWS Transcribe streaming integration maintaining identical user experience
- Created feature flag system (--use_aws_transcribe) for backend selection
- Implemented conditional resource loading preventing unnecessary Whisper model loading when using AWS
- Added comprehensive error handling for AWS credential and connectivity issues
- Generated complete setup documentation in README_AWS_INTEGRATION.md

## Open Questions/Issues

**2025-06-02 01:18:44** - Testing and Validation Phase Considerations
- Need user validation of both local Whisper and AWS Transcribe functionality
- Dependency management: boto3 and amazon-transcribe packages required for AWS usage
- Performance comparison needed between local and cloud transcription
- Multi-language support testing across both backends
- Production deployment considerations (AWS credentials, network connectivity)
- Potential future enhancements: configuration file support, additional cloud providers
